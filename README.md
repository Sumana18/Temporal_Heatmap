### INTRODUCTION

A heat map is a two-dimensional representation of data in which values are represented by colors. A simple heat map provides an immediate visual summary of information. More elaborate heat maps allow the viewer to understand complex data sets.
Temporal visualization and analysis refers to the process of looking at or analyzing features or data that are dependent variables where time is an independent variable.

### OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT

- Generation of heatmap using R
- Temporal visualization of heatmaps
- Interpretation of output obtained

### SOFTWARE AND DATA USED

- #### SOFTWARE USED

  R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years.
  Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS. It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications. It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms, especially since version 5 in 1993.

- #### DATA USED
  Crime data is taken from the free website Kaggle.com, which is Vancouver 's Open Data Catalogue. From Theft, Road Accidents, Bank Theft, Mischief, etc data sets, we had taken according to our project requirements Vehicular Accidents Resulting in Death data. This data also contains coordinates, locations names, time and date of crime incidents, Coordinates help in placing the heatmap on the basemap of the area.

### METHODOLOGY
